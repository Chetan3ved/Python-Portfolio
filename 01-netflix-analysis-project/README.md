## ðŸ“Š Analysis Steps
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Handled missing values
   - Converted dates to datetime format
   - Added `year_added` and `month_added` columns
   - Parsed `duration` into `duration_value` and `duration_unit`
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Movies vs TV Shows distribution
   - Titles added per year
   - Top countries
   - Top genres
   - Ratings distribution
   - Movies vs TV trend over time
   - Top actors & directors
   - Duration analysis (movies in minutes, TV shows in seasons)
   - Seasonality of additions by month
3. **Visualization**
   - Created plots using Matplotlib & Seaborn
   - Saved charts to `/images` folder for easy viewing
